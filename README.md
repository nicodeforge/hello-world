# hello-world
=========================
My name is Nico Deforge, I'm a 4th year student in a French business cool. I've always found GitHub super-cool, so here I am ! I will probably try to work on web-based application, but who knows, I might as well end up drawing cartoon (I'll post them anyway) !
